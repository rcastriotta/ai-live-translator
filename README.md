# ai-live-translator
ai-live-translator creates a transcript from a live speaker and then translates it into a variety of languages chosen by a listening user.
It uses text-to-speech to then broadcast the speakers words in a new language. This system is able to maintain a very low delay and is ideal for 
continuous university style lecture scenerios. A speaker can generate a new room, is given an access code, and can share this access code to an unlimited amount of clients. Each client can choose from a dropdown their preferred langauge.
